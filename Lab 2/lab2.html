    <h3>Grading</h3>
    <p>The final grade will be determined from the following breakdown:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Mid-Term: 20%</li>
        <li>Final: 20%</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The grade calculations will be as follows:</p>

        <li>80% + -> B</li>
        <li>70% + -> C</li>
        <li>60% + -> D</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Assignments</h3>
    <p>
        Assignments are typically small programs that generally deal with implementing a specific aspect within web development. 
        The due date of all assignments will be announced when they are assigned. Late assignments will be given a 20% penalty 
        for each day it is late.
    </p>

    <h3>Tests/Quizzes</h3>
    <p>
        There will be a mid-term and a final, both of which will either be “take-home” tests or administered through Canvas. 
        “Take-home” tests will then be demonstrated to the instructor for evaluation. Any quizzes will be announced at least 
        a week in advance.
    </p>

    <h3>Cheating</h3>
    <p>
        Academic dishonesty is defined as cheating, plagiarism, or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses. Plagiarism 
        is defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts, or work of another as one's own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism 
        by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion. Cheating is defined as but not limited to: obtaining or providing unauthorized 
        information during an examination through verbal, visual, or unauthorized use of books, notes, text, and other materials; 
        obtaining or providing unauthorized information concerning all or part of an examination prior to that examination; taking an 
        examination for another student or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place; altering test answers after 
        submittal for grading; changing grades after grades have been awarded; or altering other official academic records.
    </p>

    <p>All academic dishonesty cases will be reported to the Vice President for Student Affairs.</p>
